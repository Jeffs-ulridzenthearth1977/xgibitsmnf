Oh man, just got out of Another Simple Favor and what.. what did I just watch? Sorta feel like I walked through a kaleidoscope holding a bowl of spaghetti made of mystery and, uh, really fine silk. That's how tangled it was. My back is seriously killing me 'cause I was on the edge of my seat for... I dunno, most of the movie? The theater was noisy AF, like it's law now to have whispering duos behind you dissect every scene, munching popcorn like it holds the secret of life. Gonna find crumbs in my pockets for days, I swear. 

So, remember when you wanna download the movie? Or was it watch the movie? Whatever. There's like, Emily 2.0 in this one, and my mind's doing cartwheels trying to decide if I even get post-modern intrigue or if it's just a bunch of pretty lights strung together by invisible string. Not sure. Urgh, where's my phone... 

> Okay, so there's this scene with ~ huge spoilers here if you're reading this out of curiosity BTW ~ where everyone starts looking at each other like ants realizing they can't swim. That's the vibe! An army of suited ants about to stage an opera in the popcorn aisle. Such glamour, such wit, and yet... confusion. The music, god, don't ask me to hum it but I remember it pounding like a caffeinated heart. But was I even awake or dozing? These directors, man, they play us like we're their marionettes.

And the end twiiiist. Dude like, if a rabbit had drama training and no fear of heights, maybe you'd get something close to what happened there. My phone buzzed right then, and I could almost hear it say are you serious? in that tone it uses. There’s a metaphor drowning in pancakes for every moment of clarity this movie fakes. Head-scratcher deluxe. 

Anyway, my thoughts are bubbles right now, hissing out of a boiling kettle. Whenever I'm asked to rewatch or download, it’s gonna be like re-entering a dream you half remember. But maybe that's called good cinema?
